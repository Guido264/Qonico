* The Emergency level was yielding "undefined", making Graylog2 fall back to the default Alert level.
* According to documentation log method should handle following invocation:
  `client.log('short message', {param: "value"})`, but instead of sending additional fields, JSON
  was treated like full message field.

0.1.0: September 3, 2013
* Replaced all console.error calls with emit('error').
  *Warning*: you really must listen for these or node will throw uncatchable exceptions!
* Bugfix: chunk count calculation was ignoring the header-overhead.
* All log operations now use a single udp socket.
* To be more friendly to lower MTUs, lowered the default buffer size to 1400 bytes.
* Added destroy() function that closes the UDP socket.
* Removed async requirement.
* Removed some unused variables.
* Removed the larger test files (256 and 512KB) because they don't fit the new default buffer limit.
