[![NPM version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/graylog2.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/graylog2) [![NPM license](http://img.shields.io/npm/l/graylog2.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/graylog2)

Graylog2 client library for Node.js, based on node-graylog. This
has been heavily modified to the point where there is not much left
of the original; however, this library should still be compatible
with the old one, except for configuration and the GLOBAL function setup
(some optional arguments in logging calls are not supported; they will be
logged as additional data).

** New: ** Chunked [GELF](https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-docs/wiki/GELF)
is now supported.

```

Short message:

```javascript
logger.log("What we've got here is...failure to communicate");
```

Long message:

```javascript
logger.log("What we've got here is...failure to communicate", "Some men you just can't reach. So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it... well, he gets it. I don't like it any more than you men.");
```

Short with additional data:

```javascript
logger.log("What we've got here is...failure to communicate", { cool: 'beans' });
```

Long with additional data:

```javascript
logger.log("What we've got here is...failure to communicate", "Some men you just can't reach. So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it... well, he gets it. I don't like it any more than you men.",
    {
        cool: "beans"
    }
